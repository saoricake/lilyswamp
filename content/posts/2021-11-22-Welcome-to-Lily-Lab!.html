		<p>
			Hello folks, we're happy to announce <strong>Lily Lab</strong> - the development blog and chatterbox of the Prof Lily collective!
		</p>

		<p>
			We decided to start up this blog because - as fans of old and indie games - staff blogs were fun for us to follow. There's something special about following the development of each game they've made as well as learning a thing or two about the creators behind them. We want to do the same, especially when we're discussing our influences.
		</p>

		<p>
			All of us are deeply in love with video games and WLW media, some of us even learning Japanese to play and read more than what is currently translated. We'd like to give a shout-out to the titles that inspire us to continue experimenting with the medium. There's a lot of excitement from our channels to really just talk about stuff we like.
		</p>

		<p>
			We hope that this blog gives insight to our shared brain cells. Every member of the collective - as we hope the staff blog will show - has their own quirks. But we do believe in the collective vision of making cool subcultural media for everyone dissatisfied with mainstream media as we are. We can do much more than tell the same love stories over and over again.
		</p>

		<p>
			That's it for now. We'll get a blog post up soon and keep you posted on what we're up to, though we'd also like to keep some things under wraps. See you later!
		</p>
