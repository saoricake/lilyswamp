			Hello, everyone. This isn't a Prof. Lily thing at all, but because two members of our collective were a part of this sexually creative endeavor, it just made sense to write a post about my English-language translation of curry's <i>Crestfallen Futanari x Femboy Priest: Prepare to Cum Edition</i>.
		</p>

		<p>
			I came up with the title by the way because the original Japanese title gives me pain and curry has admitted it's just a random title they came up in a few seconds. I figured something more catchy would help sales.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, what is this eromanga about?
		</p>

		<p>
			If we don't count the title page and the afterword, the eromanga between a futanari swordmaster and a femboy priest is 37 pages long. The first 16 pages is dedicated to dense RPG fantasy worldbuilding that works as an introduction to <b>the hot and raunchy sex</b>.
		</p>

		<p>
			If that sounds amazing to you, check it out. I genuinely enjoyed translating this work and I hope the translation is a testament to our ancient friendship.
		</p>

		<hr>

		<p>
			So, why did I choose to translate this?
		</p>

		<p>
			To tell you the truth, I stan my friends. I've been friends with curry for almost a decade now (holy shit) since we both know Japanese and are avid eroge consumers. It's incredible seeing their art grow into what it is today. As a result, I've always wanted to work with them on a creative project, which is sorta why I immediately asked them if they wanted to join Prof. Lily.
		</p>

		<p>
			I saw this comic getting cooked up while we were working on the GFT demo. Drafts and passages of texts were spammed into our goof zone channel and I was very enamored with their stuff. I was already a fan of their previous original work, an extremely ridiculous science fiction yuri work, so I asked curry if I could translate the comic whenever they finished it.
		</p>

		<p>
			And so, that was that.
		</p>

		<hr>

		<p>
			Speaking of which, translating the comic was surprisingly fun. It provided a lot of challenges as I had to consider JRPG meta and the let's-just-say unique character voice of the femboy priest.
		</p>

		<p>
			I've always enjoyed the "problem-solving aspect" of translation where I have to puzzle out linguistic enigmas and since the creator actually knew English, I didn't have to worry too much about miscommunication. I was pleased to hear that curry enjoyed how I captured the priest's voice since that's where the main amount of effort was put in.
		</p>

		<p>
			But I'll let the reader decide if I actually did the work justice. All I can say is that getting the dialog and worldbuilding down into concise language that was already  brimming with personality was an undeniably fun exercise. curry's storytelling is wonderful and I hope my translation shows a semblance of that!
		</p>

		<hr>

		<p>
			Other than that, I also think this comic would perhaps be a great introduction to two of the most cumbrained members of the collective too. Unsurprisingly, a lot of our terrible and problematic ideas are shot down almost immediately when we're brainstorming visual novel ideas and this eromanga is probably a good insight as to why.
		</p>

		<p>
			But I also believe this comic, while not exactly Prof. Lily, is emblematic of our inspiration to make eroge. We won't shy away from telling stories we want to tell, whether it be political or pornographic, even if capitalism wants us to do boring het shit.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, let's make provocative ero media together, one femboy priest at a time.
		</p>
